# Small tools for my geology workflow

My geological workflow is quite unique, so this tools rarely could be used commonly, but with some modifications they are could be useful.
Generaly here you can find some python and shell scripts to work with different GPS data, which saves me a lot of time on my routines, and makes possible avoid using proprietary GIS software.

##csv2polygon.py
This script converts set of vertices of the mining concession (UTM coordinates) to *.wkt format (Well Known Text). Output file can be used in QGIS, which is great to plan field work and visualize limits of area of interest.
